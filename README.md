# puppet-owncloud

This puppet module is to deploy owncloud in fedora or fedora-like distributions.  I had trouble with other puppet deployments because paths and otherthings can be different. 

Goals
* to have a separate owncloud server that worked on a fedora based system

Troubles that need ironing out, manually for now.
